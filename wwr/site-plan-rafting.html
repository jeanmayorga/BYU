      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Our target audience is individuals and groups, primarily between the
        ages of 18-45, who are interested in outdoor recreational activities and
        seeking adventure and thrills in their lives. They may have a moderate
        to high level of fitness, enjoy nature, and have a disposable income to
        spend on outdoor experiences. They are likely to be students,
        professionals, and families living in or visiting the Provo/Orem area.
        They want to have a unique and memorable experience while also learning
        about safety and environmental responsibility. They may not be aware of
        the various options available to them for rafting in the BYU area. They
        will typically access our site from their desktop or mobile device while
        researching and planning their outdoor activities.
